# Google-Books-Search
`A React-based Google Books Search app using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.`

In this activity, I created a new React-based Google Books Search app. This app was created with React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
